# Airport Management System - Required Python Libraries

# Standard library modules like uuid, datetime, and json are already included in Python.
# Only include external libraries if needed.

# Currently, no external libraries are required.
# But if in the future you use features like web framework or UI, you'll add them here.

# Example (Uncomment if using later):
# flask
# streamlit
# pandas
